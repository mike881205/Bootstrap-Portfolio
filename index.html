                        Born and raised in South Florida, I earned my bachelor's degree in marketing through the Universtiy of Central Florida. After graduating, I moved to Los Angeles in 2014 and began my sales career in the music industry working with DW Drums Inc. I realized that I wanted to pursue a career back home in Florida, and returned to Orlando in 2017.

                        Currently, I am the purchasing coordinator for a garment printing/fulfillment company called Threadbird. What I like most about my current position is resolving the logistic issues that are inherent with purchasing product for a company. I view it as a challenge and a puzzle which is why I decided that I wanted to earn a full stack certification in coding. I feel that coding is much like a puzzle in that it requires you to find or create the right piece to complete the bigger picture.

                        My proudest accomplishment is my work designing the first 8-String guitar for Ovation Guitars (Owned by DW Drums Inc.). My current goal is to earn a position as a front end web or app developer. I'm driven by creating unique opportunites within the market through innovative and new ideas, and I aim to use my coding experience to create those opportunities.

                        When I'm not working or coding, I enjoy playing music with friends, gaming, and spending time with my girlfriend and our cats, Dwight & Stella.
